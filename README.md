1. What is Email Advertising for Bloggers?

    Monetization: Email marketing is crucial for launching products, affiliate marketing, and promoting services

.

Loyalty & Community: Regular emails foster loyalty and a sense of community.

Traffic: Sending newsletters or post alerts increases blog traffic, often generating the highest return visits
